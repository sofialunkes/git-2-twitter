# Git2twitter



## WHAT IS FOR?

The main objective of this web app is to provide a way to tweet the commits that are made in the remote repository (not going local because.. u don't know what can happen in meantime).



## Get running

 Run `ng serve` renders the app at `http://localhost:4200/`. <br>
 The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
